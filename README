STATUS
======

I kinda hate the API I invented here. Maybe a derivative would be useful in the future. Note that inherited_resources has a similar thing (refer to "@post" as "resource" in your PostsController), but that only works if you're using ir, and even then only for controllers which are using ir.

DESCRIPTION
===========

Restflection is a Ruby on Rails plugin designed for use in
applications which followRESTful conventions. It allows you
to extract information about resources without necessarily
knowing what they are called.
